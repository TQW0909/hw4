# Do not ignore the .gitignore or any of the other files we've bundled in this
# repository by default. They are intended to remain in your repository.

# We've gone ahead and set up a .gitignore for you. However, as we discussed in
# the git lab, this won't ignore binaries that don't have the .o extension. You
# can add rules to ignore those in this file or you can create an additional
# .gitignore and add the new rule in the relevant subdirectory to what you're
# working on.
#
# You can have a .gitignore in any directory of your repository. If there are
# multiple, they will all work. Note that paths specified in a .gitignore will
# always be relative to where the .gitignore is located, so if you want to
# ignore hw1/executable by putting a .gitignore in hw1/, you would add rule:
#
# executable
#
# If you wanted to ignore hw1/executable from this file, you'd write the
# following at the bottom of this file:
#
# hw1/executable
